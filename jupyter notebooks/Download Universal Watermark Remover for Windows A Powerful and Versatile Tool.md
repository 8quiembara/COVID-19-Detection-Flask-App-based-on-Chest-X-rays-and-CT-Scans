Universal Watermark Remover for Windows is a handy tool for anyone who wants to get rid of the annoying watermark on their desktop. However, it is not the only way to remove the watermark. There are other methods that involve editing the registry or using third-party software. These methods may have some advantages or disadvantages depending on your situation and preference.
 
One alternative method is to use the registry editor to change a value that controls the display of the watermark. This method is simple and does not require downloading any files, but it may not work for all versions of Windows or watermarks. It may also cause some issues with your system if you make a mistake while editing the registry. To use this method, follow these steps:

- Press Windows + R to open Run, type regedit, and hit Enter.
- Click Yes in the UAC prompt.
- In the address bar, paste the following path and hit Enter: Computer\HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\Control Panel\Desktop
- Locate and double-click on PaintDesktopVersion from the entries on the right.
- Change its value data from 1 to 0 and click OK.
- Restart your computer and check if the watermark is gone.

Another alternative method is to use a third-party software that can remove or customize the watermark. There are many such software available online, but some of them may contain malware or unwanted programs. You should always be careful when downloading and installing any software from unknown sources. One of the most popular and trusted software for this purpose is Universal Watermark Disabler, which we have already discussed in this article.
