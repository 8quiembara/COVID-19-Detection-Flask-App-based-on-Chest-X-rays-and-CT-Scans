This way, the application prevents unauthorized users from accessing important data through USB ports.
  
The application works by encrypting the data stored on the USB drives and requiring a password or a biometric authentication to access it. The encryption algorithm is based on the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and ensures that the data is secure even if the USB drive is lost or stolen. The application also logs the activity of the USB devices and sends alerts to the administrator in case of any suspicious behavior.
