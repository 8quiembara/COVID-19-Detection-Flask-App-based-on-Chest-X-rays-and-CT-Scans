In this article, we will show you how to use the Comback 7 0 ir pro for different thermography applications, and what features and benefits it offers compared to other infrared cameras on the market.
  
## What is the Comback 7 0 ir pro?
 
The Comback 7 0 ir pro is a high-performance infrared camera that combines a large touchscreen display, a high-resolution detector, a fast frame rate, and a wide temperature range. It also has a dual-lens system that allows you to switch between a wide-angle lens and a telephoto lens without changing the camera settings.
 
The Comback 7 0 ir pro has a thermal sensitivity of 0.03Â°C, which means it can detect very small temperature differences and display them in vivid colors. It also has a measurement accuracy of Â±2Â°C or Â±2%, which ensures that your readings are precise and consistent.
 
The Comback 7 0 ir pro has a built-in digital camera that can capture visible light images and videos, as well as an integrated laser pointer and LED flashlight that can help you locate and illuminate your target. You can also use the picture-in-picture (PIP) function to overlay the thermal image on the visible image, or the fusion function to blend them together for better analysis.
  
## How to Use the Comback 7 0 ir pro for Electrical Thermography?
 
Electrical thermography is one of the most common and important applications of infrared cameras. It can help you detect faults and defects in electrical components, such as wires, connectors, fuses, circuit breakers, transformers, motors, generators, etc. By measuring the temperature of these components, you can identify hot spots, loose connections, overloads, short circuits, or other problems that can cause failures or fires.

1. Turn on the camera and select the electrical mode from the menu. This will adjust the camera settings to suit electrical applications.
2. Choose the appropriate lens for your inspection. The wide-angle lens is suitable for large or close-up objects, while the telephoto lens is ideal for small or distant objects.
3. Point the camera at the electrical component you want to inspect and focus the image using the manual or automatic focus function.
4. Capture the thermal image by pressing the trigger button. You can also record a thermal video by pressing the record button.
5. Review the thermal image or video on the touchscreen display. You can use the zoom function to magnify the image, or the cursor function to measure the temperature of any point on the image.
6. Save the thermal image or video to the internal memory or an external SD card. You can also transfer it to your computer or smartphone via USB cable, Wi-Fi, or Bluetooth.
7. Analyze the thermal image or video using the Comback software. You can adjust the color palette, emissivity, ambient temperature, distance, humidity, and other parameters to improve the image quality and accuracy. You can also add annotations, comments, voice notes, or reports to document your findings.

## How to Use the Comback 7 0 ir pro for Building Thermography?
 
Building thermography is another popular and useful application of infrared cameras. It can help you evaluate the thermal performance of buildings and structures, such as walls, roofs, windows, doors, insulation, etc. By measuring the surface temperature of these elements, you can detect heat loss or gain, air leakage, moisture intrusion, mold growth, or other issues that can affect energy efficiency and comfort.
 
To use the Comback 7 0 ir pro for building thermography, you need to follow these steps:

1. Turn on the camera and select the building mode from the menu. This will adjust the camera settings to suit building applications.
