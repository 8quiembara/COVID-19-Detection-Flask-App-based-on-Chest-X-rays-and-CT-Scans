Cost accounting is different from financial accounting, which is mainly concerned with reporting the financial performance and position of a business to external users such as investors, creditors and regulators. Financial accounting follows generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) and other standards and regulations, while cost accounting is more flexible and adaptable to the specific needs and objectives of management. Cost accounting can also provide more detailed and timely information than financial accounting, which is usually prepared at the end of an accounting period.
 
There are various types of cost accounting methods that can be used for different purposes and situations. Some of the common types of cost accounting are standard costing, activity-based costing, lean accounting and marginal costing. Each type of cost accounting has its own advantages and disadvantages, and may require different data sources, assumptions and calculations. Cost accounting methods can also be combined or modified to suit the preferences and goals of management.
 
Cost accounting can help a business to improve its efficiency, profitability and competitiveness by providing valuable information for planning, controlling, evaluating and decision-making. Cost accounting can help a business to:
 
- Identify the costs of producing a product or providing a service
- Allocate costs to various activities, processes, departments and products
- Analyze the cost behavior and drivers of different costs
- Compare actual costs with budgeted or standard costs
- Calculate the break-even point and margin of safety
- Determine the optimal product mix and pricing strategy
- Reduce waste and inefficiencies
- Benchmark performance against competitors or industry standards
