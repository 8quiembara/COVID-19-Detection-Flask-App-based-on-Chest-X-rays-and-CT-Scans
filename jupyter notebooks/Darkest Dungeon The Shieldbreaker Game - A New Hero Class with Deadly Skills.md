One of the heroes you can add to your roster is the Shieldbreaker, a DLC character that was released in October 2017. The Shieldbreaker is a versatile and deadly warrior who can pierce through enemy armor and shields with her spear and shield. She can also use her snake dance ability to move around the battlefield, dodging attacks and striking from unexpected angles. The Shieldbreaker is a great asset for any party that faces heavily armored foes or those who protect their allies.
 
However, the Shieldbreaker also has a dark past that haunts her dreams. Every time she camps, she may trigger a nightmare sequence that forces her to confront her fears and memories. These nightmares are dangerous and stressful, but also offer unique loot and trinkets if you can survive them. The Shieldbreaker's nightmares add a new layer of challenge and story to the game, making her one of the most interesting and complex characters in Darkest Dungeon.
 
If you're looking for a new hero to spice up your Darkest Dungeon experience, you should definitely check out the Shieldbreaker DLC. It's available on Steam for $3.99[^1^] and it adds a lot of depth and variety to the game. The Shieldbreaker is a powerful ally in the fight to reclaim the Estate and banish the evil that squats in the Darkest Dungeon.

The Shieldbreaker DLC also adds some new features and content to the base game. It introduces a new type of enemy, the snakes, which are agile and venomous foes that can inflict blight and stun. The snakes can appear in any dungeon, but they are more common in the Shieldbreaker's nightmares. The DLC also adds three new trinkets for the Shieldbreaker, each with a unique effect and a drawback. These trinkets can only be obtained by completing the Shieldbreaker's nightmares.
 
Another feature of the DLC is the addition of a new district to the Hamlet, the Nomad Wagon. The Nomad Wagon is a shop where you can buy rare and exotic trinkets for your heroes. The Nomad Wagon has a limited stock that changes every week, so you'll have to check it regularly to see what's available. The Nomad Wagon also sells some exclusive trinkets that can only be found there, such as the Crimson Court set and the Shieldbreaker set.
 
The Shieldbreaker DLC is a great addition to Darkest Dungeon that enhances the gameplay and the story of the game. It offers a new hero with a unique playstyle and backstory, as well as new enemies, trinkets and a district. If you're a fan of Darkest Dungeon, you should definitely give the Shieldbreaker DLC a try.
