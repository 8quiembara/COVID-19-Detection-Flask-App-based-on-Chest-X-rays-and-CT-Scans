# How to Install CWM Recovery on Samsung Galaxy Y GT-S5360
 
If you are looking for a way to install a custom ROM on your Samsung Galaxy Y GT-S5360, you will need a custom recovery first. A custom recovery is a software that replaces the stock recovery of your device and allows you to perform advanced tasks such as backup and restore, wipe data, flash zip files, and more. One of the most popular custom recoveries for Android devices is ClockworkMod Recovery, or CWM for short.
 
CWM Recovery was developed by Koushik Dutta (Koush), a well-known name in the Android development community. It has a simple and intuitive interface that can be controlled with the volume and power buttons of your device. It also has a ROM Manager app that lets you access some of its features from within Android.
