- The movie contains one of the longest no-cut fight scenes in movie history: the fight up floor after floor lasted four-plus minutes. This scene was inspired by Bruce Lee's Game of Death, where he fought different opponents on different levels of a pagoda.
- The movie was originally titled Tom Yum Goong, which is a popular Thai spicy soup with shrimp. The title was changed to The Protector in some countries to avoid confusion with the dish. However, the original title also has a symbolic meaning, as tom yum goong is considered a national dish of Thailand, and Kham is fighting to protect his national treasure, the elephant.
- The movie features several different martial arts styles, such as Muay Thai, Capoeira, Wushu, Taekwondo, and Jujutsu. Tony Jaa trained with different masters to learn these styles and incorporate them into his choreography. He also performed all his own stunts without wires or CGI.
- The movie was shot in Thailand and Australia, and involved real elephants. The elephants were trained by experts and treated with care and respect. Tony Jaa formed a close bond with the elephants and even slept with them on set. He also donated part of his salary to an elephant conservation fund.
- The movie was a huge success in Thailand and other Asian countries, but faced some difficulties in the US market. The Weinstein Company bought the rights to distribute the movie in the US, but cut 28 minutes from the original version and added a new score by RZA. Many fans and critics were unhappy with these changes and preferred the original version.

Tom Yum Goong is a movie that showcases Tony Jaa's incredible talent and passion for martial arts and elephants.
