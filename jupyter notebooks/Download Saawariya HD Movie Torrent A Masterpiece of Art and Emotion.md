One of the most astonishing movies ever made in Indian cinema is Saawariya, a film that showcases the brilliant vision and craftsmanship of director Sanjay Leela Bhansali. Based on a short story by Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Saawariya is a fairy tale romance set in a dreamlike town where two souls find each other and experience the magic of love. The film is a visual feast, with stunning cinematography, lighting, costumes and sets that create a mesmerizing atmosphere. The music by Monty Sharma is soothing and soulful, with songs that capture the emotions of the characters and the mood of the scenes. The film also marks the debut of two talented actors, Ranbir Kapoor and Sonam Kapoor, who play the lead roles of Raj and Sakina. They deliver marvelous performances, showing confidence, charm and chemistry. They bring their characters to life with sincerity and passion, making them memorable and iconic. Raj is a free-spirited musician who arrives in the town and befriends Gulab, a prostitute played by Rani Mukerji, who narrates the story. He also meets Lillian, an old woman played by Zohra Sehgal, who gives him shelter and treats him like her lost son. Sakina is a beautiful and mysterious girl who waits for her lover Imaan, played by Salman Khan, to return on Eid. Raj falls in love with Sakina at first sight and tries to win her heart, but she is torn between her loyalty to Imaan and her attraction to Raj. The film explores their journey towards true love, with moments of joy, sorrow, hope and sacrifice. Saawariya is not a typical Bollywood film that follows a conventional plot or logic. It is an artistic expression of Bhansali's imagination and creativity. It is a film that transports the viewers to a different world, where they can experience the beauty and power of love. Saawariya is a masterpiece that deserves to be framed in gold as an example of how Indian cinema can evolve and excel.

However, Saawariya is not a film that appeals to everyone. Many critics and viewers have found it boring, clichÃ©d, self-indulgent and unrealistic. They have criticized the film for its lack of plot, its slow pace, its excessive length and its melodramatic tone. They have also complained about the film's dark and blue color palette, which makes the town look gloomy and depressing. Some have argued that the film is a poor adaptation of Dostoyevsky's story, which has a more complex and subtle psychological dimension. Others have compared the film unfavorably to other Bollywood films that have dealt with similar themes of love and sacrifice, such as Devdas, Veer-Zaara and Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge.
