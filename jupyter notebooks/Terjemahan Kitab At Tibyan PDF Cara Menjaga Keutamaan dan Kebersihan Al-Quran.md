Here are some examples of the etiquette of carrying the Quran that are mentioned in the book:

1. One should be in a state of ritual purity (wudu) when touching or holding the Quran. This is based on the verse: "None touch it except the purified." (Quran 56:79)
2. One should use a clean and respectful place to put the Quran when not in use. This is based on the hadith: "The Quran should not be placed under a pillow or on the floor or in a dirty place." (Al-Bayhaqi)
3. One should avoid placing other books or objects on top of the Quran. This is based on the hadith: "Do not place anything over the Quran." (Abu Dawud)
4. One should recite the Quran with a clear and beautiful voice, without exaggeration or distortion. This is based on the hadith: "Beautify the Quran with your voices." (Abu Dawud)
5. One should listen attentively and respectfully when the Quran is being recited. This is based on the verse: "So when the Quran is recited, then listen to it and pay attention that you may receive mercy." (Quran 7:204)
6. One should act upon the commands and prohibitions of the Quran and follow its guidance. This is based on the verse: "Do you order righteousness of the people and forget yourselves while you recite the Scripture? Then will you not reason?" (Quran 2:44)

The book also contains many stories and anecdotes that illustrate the virtues and benefits of carrying the Quran and its people. For example, there is a story of a man who was saved from a snake bite by reciting a verse from the Quran. There is also a story of a woman who was cured from a severe illness by writing some verses from the Quran and drinking their water. There is also a story of a man who was granted victory over his enemies by placing the Quran on his chest.
 
The book is a treasure of knowledge and wisdom that can enrich one's relationship with the Quran and increase one's love and devotion for it. It is highly recommended for anyone who wants to learn more about the etiquette of carrying the Quran and its people.
