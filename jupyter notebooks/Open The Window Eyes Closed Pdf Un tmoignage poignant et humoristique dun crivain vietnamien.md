He also invents stories to explain the mysteries of life and death. He believes that his grandfather's soul has become a star, that his father is still alive somewhere, and that his mother can hear his thoughts.
 
Another theme of this novel is the importance of family and friendship. Tuan loves his mother and grandfather deeply, and they are his main sources of support and comfort. He also cherishes his friendship with Thanh, a girl who lives next door and shares his passion for music. Together, they face many difficulties and dangers, but they also have fun and learn from each other. They help each other to grow and to cope with their losses.
 
A third theme of this novel is the power of music and art. Tuan has a natural talent for music and art, which he inherits from his grandfather and father. He plays the harmonica, the guitar, and the piano. He also draws and paints beautiful pictures. Music and art are his ways of expressing his feelings and emotions, as well as communicating with others. They also bring him joy and peace, as well as recognition and admiration.
