GameMaker Studio is a powerful and easy-to-use game development tool that lets you create games with drag-and-drop or code. You can use the built-in editors to design sprites, backgrounds, tiles, objects, rooms, sounds, and scripts. You can also import assets from external sources or use the marketplace to find and buy resources made by other users.
 
GameMaker Studio uses its own programming language called GameMaker Language (GML), which is similar to C and JavaScript. You can use GML to write your own game logic, control the game flow, and interact with the game engine. You can also use the visual scripting system called Drag and Drop (DnD), which allows you to create games without writing any code. You can mix and match GML and DnD as you wish.
 
GameMaker Studio has been used to create many successful and popular games, such as Undertale, Hyper Light Drifter, Hotline Miami, Spelunky, Risk of Rain, Nuclear Throne, and more. You can find more examples of games made with GameMaker Studio on their showcase page. You can also publish your own games on various platforms and share them with the world.

If you want to learn GML, you can use the built-in tutorials and documentation that come with GameMaker Studio. You can also find many online resources, such as books, videos, blogs, forums, and courses that teach you how to use GML and GameMaker Studio. Some of the recommended resources are:
