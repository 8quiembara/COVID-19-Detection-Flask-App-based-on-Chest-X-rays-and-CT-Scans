1. Locate the serial number on your gun. The serial number is usually stamped on the bottom of the grip frame, behind the cylinder. You might need to remove the grips to see it clearly. The serial number should start with a letter followed by four or five digits, such as BAF1234.
2. Look up the serial number on a Smith & Wesson serial number database. There are several online resources that can help you decode your serial number and provide information about your gun. One of them is [Recoil Review](https://recoilreview.com/smith-wesson-serial-number-database-how-to-use-it/), which has a comprehensive guide on how to use Smith & Wesson serial number databases. You can also contact Smith & Wesson customer service at 1-800-331-0852 and ask them to verify your serial number.
3. Learn more about your gun based on the serial number. The serial number can reveal the year of manufacture, the model name and number, the caliber, the barrel length, the finish, the sights, and any special features or modifications. For example, a serial number starting with BAF indicates that the gun was made in 1989, and that it is a Model 686-3 with a 4-inch barrel and a standard hammer and trigger.

Knowing the serial number of your Smith & Wesson 686-3 can help you appreciate its value and history. It can also be useful for insurance purposes, legal matters, or collecting purposes.
