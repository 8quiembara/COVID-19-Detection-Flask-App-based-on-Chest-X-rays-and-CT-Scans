# How to Use Krakatoa for Stunning Volumetric Effects in 3ds Max 2014
 
Krakatoa is a powerful particle renderer that can create stunning volumetric effects such as dust, smoke, fire, water, and even solid objects. It can handle millions and even billions of particles with ease, and it works seamlessly with 3ds Max 2014. In this article, we will show you how to use Krakatoa to create some amazing scenes in 3ds Max 2014.

## What is Krakatoa?
 
Krakatoa is a product of AWS Thinkbox, a company that specializes in creating tools for visual effects and animation. Krakatoa is available for Autodesk 3ds Max, Autodesk Maya, Cinema 4D, or as a standalone particle renderer with a powerful C++ API that can be used to connect it to other 3D and 2D applications such as SideFX Houdini, The Foundry's Nuke, MAXON, and more[^1^].
 
Krakatoa supports per-particle Scatter, Emission, Absorption and Density data channels, as well as various light scattering models to allow deep levels of control over the final image. It also supports motion blur and depth of field camera effects. Krakatoa has been used in many blockbuster movies such as Avatar, Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows 2, The Avengers and Star Trek: Into Darkness[^1^].
 
## How to Use Krakatoa in 3ds Max 2014?
 
To use Krakatoa in 3ds Max 2014, you need to install the Krakatoa MX2 plugin for 3ds Max. You can download it from the AWS Thinkbox website[^1^]. Once installed, you will find a new menu item called Thinkbox in your 3ds Max interface. From there, you can access the Krakatoa features such as the PRT Loader, PRT Volume, PRT Hair, PRT Surface, PRT FumeFX and more.

The basic workflow of using Krakatoa in 3ds Max is as follows:
 
1. Create or import your particle source. This can be any object that generates particles such as Particle Flow, FumeFX, Phoenix FD, Frost, Hair and Fur, etc.
2. Convert your particle source to a PRT object using one of the Krakatoa modifiers or helpers. PRT stands for Particle Render Toolset and it is the native format of Krakatoa. A PRT object stores all the particle data such as position, velocity, color, density, etc. in a file or memory.
3. Adjust the settings of your PRT object to control how the particles are rendered by Krakatoa. You can use the Magma Editor to create custom data channels and expressions for your particles. You can also use Matte objects to mask out parts of your scene.
4. Render your scene using the Krakatoa renderer. You can choose from different render modes such as Final Render, Draft Render or Interactive Render. You can also export Render Elements for compositing.
