# Geometria Proyectiva Santalo PDF: A Classic Textbook on Projective Geometry
  
Geometria Proyectiva Santalo PDF is a digital version of the book Geometria Proyectiva by Luis Antonio Santalo, a Spanish mathematician who was a professor in Argentina. The book was first published in 1966 and is considered a classic textbook on projective geometry, a branch of mathematics that studies the properties of geometric figures that are invariant under projective transformations.

Projective geometry is a fascinating and elegant subject that has applications in art, architecture, computer vision, cryptography, and more. It also provides a foundation for non-Euclidean geometries, such as hyperbolic geometry, which are essential for modern physics and cosmology.
  
In Geometria Proyectiva Santalo PDF, Santalo covers 15 classical topics of projective geometry, such as the fundamental theorem of projective geometry, the cross-ratio, harmonic quadruples, pole and polar, and quadrics. He also introduces some modern aspects of the subject, such as projectivities with non-commutative fields, quadrics over non-commutative fields, and finite geometries. He uses abstract algebra concepts, such as groups, rings, fields, vector spaces, and linear mappings, to enrich the vocabulary and the proofs of projective geometry.
  
The book is written in Spanish and contains 240 exercises at the end of 25 sections, with solutions on pages 347-365. It is suitable for advanced undergraduate and graduate students who have some background in algebra and geometry. It is also a valuable reference for researchers and teachers who want to learn more about this beautiful and important area of mathematics.

Geometria Proyectiva Santalo PDF is a rare gem that offers a comprehensive and rigorous introduction to projective geometry. It is a must-read for anyone who wants to explore the beauty and the power of this mathematical discipline.
  
One of the main features of projective geometry is the principle of duality, which states that any theorem or definition in projective geometry remains valid if the words point and line are interchanged. For example, the dual of a point is a line, the dual of a line is a point, the dual of incidence is containment, and so on. This principle allows us to obtain new results from existing ones by simply applying the dual transformation.

Another important concept in projective geometry is the notion of perspective. Two figures are said to be in perspective if they are related by a projective transformation that preserves collinearity. For instance, two triangles are in perspective if their corresponding vertices lie on three concurrent lines, called the axes of perspectivity. Similarly, two conics are in perspective if their corresponding points lie on four concurrent lines, called the lines of perspectivity.
  
Santalo's book Geometria Proyectiva Santalo PDF contains many examples and applications of these and other concepts in projective geometry. He also discusses some historical aspects of the subject, such as the contributions of Desargues, Pascal, Brianchon, Poncelet, and others. He also relates projective geometry to other branches of mathematics, such as algebraic geometry, differential geometry, and topology.
  
Geometria Proyectiva Santalo PDF is a masterpiece that reflects Santalo's deep knowledge and passion for projective geometry. It is a book that will inspire and challenge anyone who wants to learn more about this fascinating and elegant subject.
