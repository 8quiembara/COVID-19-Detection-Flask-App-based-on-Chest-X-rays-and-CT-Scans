The third step is to design your game using the RTS Creator interface. You will see four main tabs: Game Settings, Units & Buildings, Resources & AI, and Maps. You can switch between them by clicking on them.
 
In the Game Settings tab, you can set up the basic parameters of your game, such as the title, description, icon, genre, camera angle, fog of war, victory conditions, etc.
 
In the Units & Buildings tab, you can add or edit the units and buildings of your game. You can choose from the built-in assets or import your own graphics. You can also set up the attributes of each unit and building, such as health, damage, speed, range, cost, etc.
 
In the Resources & AI tab, you can add or edit the resources and AI of your game. You can choose from the built-in assets or import your own graphics. You can also set up the attributes of each resource and AI, such as amount, regeneration rate, harvesting speed, etc.
 
In the Maps tab, you can create or edit the maps of your game. You can choose from the built-in maps or import your own images. You can also use the map editor to draw terrain, place objects, set spawn points, etc.
 
## Step 4: Test and Publish Your Game
 
The final step is to test and publish your game online. You can test your game at any time by clicking on the "Play" button at the top right corner of the screen. You will see how your game looks and plays in real time.
 
If you are satisfied with your game, you can publish it online by clicking on the "Publish" button at the top right corner of the screen.
