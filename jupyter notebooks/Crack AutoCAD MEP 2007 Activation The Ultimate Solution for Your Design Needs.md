## Features and Benefits of AutoCAD Raster Design 2008
 
AutoCAD Raster Design 2008 is not only a software for downloading and installing, but also a powerful tool for enhancing your CAD projects with raster images. It offers many features and benefits that can help you work faster and smarter with your raster data. Here are some of them:

- The Raster Design palette provides comprehensive image data including image properties, image colors, and image file location. You can easily access and manage your raster images from this palette.[^1^]
- Specialized tools that give the same results as basic AutoCAD with quicker, more efficient workflows. You can use commands like Raster Entity Manipulation (REM), Vectorization, Image Transformation, Image Cleanup, and Image Analysis to edit and manipulate your raster images.[^1^] [^2^]
- Define regions of varying shapes in the raster image and manipulate them individually. You can use tools like Region Outline, Region Fill, Region Erase, Region Copy, Region Move, and Region Rotate to create and modify raster regions.[^1^]
- Edit REM objects using standard AutoCAD commands. You can use commands like Move, Copy, Rotate, Scale, Mirror, Trim, Extend, Break, Join, and Explode on raster lines, arcs, circles, and regions.[^1^]
- Simplify your workflows with vectorization tools. You can create lines and polylines from raster images, and convert raster files into vector drawings. You can use tools like Vectorization Preview, Vectorization Settings, Vectorization Snap Settings, Vectorize Image, and Vectorize Background to vectorize your raster images.[^1^]
- Show and analyze geo images in Civil 3D civil engineering software and the AutoCAD Map 3D toolset. You can use tools like GeoTIFF Import/Export, GeoTIFF Information Display/Update, GeoTIFF Coordinate System Display/Update, GeoTIFF World File Display/Update, GeoTIFF Image Transformation Settings Display/Update, GeoTIFF Image Transformation Apply/Remove to work with geo-referenced raster images.[^1^]
- Support a wide range of image formatsâfrom bitonal, color, and aerial to multispectral satellite imageryâall within applications based on AutoCAD 2008 software. You can use tools like Image Insertion/Removal/Unloading/Reloading/Repathing/Frame Display On/Off/Image Information/Image Format Conversion/Image Capture to work with different types of raster images.[^2^]
- Embed bitonal images within the drawing file so a single DWG file can contain both imagery and design data without using separate image reference files. You can use the Embed Image command to embed your bitonal images into your DWG file.[^2^]
- Directly edit multiresolution files such as LizardTechâs MrSIDÂ®, ER Mapperâs ECW, and industry-standard JPEG 2000 formats. You can use the Edit Multiresolution command to edit your multiresolution files without losing their compression benefits.[^2^]
- Support for multiframe images during image insertion, which provides greater clarity into the origination of the image data sources and enables the user to make better use of the image data. You can use the Insert Multiframe command to insert multiframe formatted images into your drawing.[^2^]

With these features and benefits, AutoCAD Raster Design 2008 can help you make the most of your raster images for your CAD projects.
