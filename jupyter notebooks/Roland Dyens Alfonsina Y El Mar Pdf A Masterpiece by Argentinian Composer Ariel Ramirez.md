Alfonsina y el Mar is not only a song, but also a poem. It was written by FÃ©lix Luna, a famous Argentine writer and historian. He was inspired by the tragic story of Alfonsina Storni, who was diagnosed with breast cancer and decided to end her life in the ocean. The poem describes her last moments, as she walks towards the sea, accompanied by the moon and the stars.
 
Alfonsina Storni was one of the most important poets of the modernist movement in Latin America. She was born in Switzerland in 1892, but moved to Argentina with her family when she was four years old. She started writing poetry at a young age, and published her first book in 1916. She was also a journalist, a teacher, and a feminist activist. She wrote about topics such as love, sexuality, gender roles, and social injustice.
 
Alfonsina Storni died in 1938, at the age of 46. She left a note in her hotel room, saying: "I am going to sleep a little. Do not disturb me." She then walked to the beach of Mar del Plata, and drowned herself in the water. Her body was found the next day by some fishermen. Her death shocked and saddened the literary world, and her poetry became even more popular and admired.
